Virgo Samples
=============

This is a collection of six sample projects that demonstrate different features of Virgo 
and different ways of setting up your project in Eclispe. Most samples contain more detailed 
READMEs in their respective directories. The 'bin' directory contains built Artifacts and 
source jars for all the samples.

The six sample projects are:

OSGi-examples
=============

This is a good starting place if you are new to OSGi, this sample dose not use Virgo and shows 
the basic concepts of OSGi modularity.

No Spring
=========

This is a simple web application that isn't powered by Spring but still uses the traditional 
Servlet container, another approach would be to use the OSGi HTTPService.

Formtags
========

This is a Spring powered web app that is shown in four different states as it is transformed 
from a legacy 'WAR' file to an OSGi application.

	1. Legacy 'WAR' based web application.
	2. Shared Libs application, a single bundle with its dependancies removed.
	3. Shared Services application now consisting of several OSGi bundles.
	4. PAR file packaging the bundles of the application together.

REST
====

This is an example of using the Spring REST features to publish a restFull API from an OSGi 
application. It contains it's own detailed README.

Configuration Properties
========================

This simple sample shows how to configure your OSGi application using configuration artifacts.

GreenPages
==========

This is a much more complex and realistic application. The 'docs' directory contains very 
detailed information on this project.
